# MachineLearning_Assignment1 Linear Regression From Scratch (My First ML Project)
About This Project

This is my first Machine Learning project.

In this project, I made Linear Regression from scratch using only:

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

I did not use scikit-learn.

# What This Project Does

It uses HR Employee Attrition dataset.

It tries to predict:

Attrition
Yes = 1
No = 0

# Features Used

I selected only 8 numerical columns:

Age

DailyRate

DistanceFromHome

HourlyRate

MonthlyIncome

MonthlyRate

NumCompaniesWorked

TotalWorkingYears

# What I Learned

How Linear Regression works

What is Gradient Descent

How weights update

What is Cost function

How to plot graphs

Steps in Code

# Load dataset

Convert Yes/No into 1/0

Select features

Normalize data

Add bias column

Initialize weights = 0

Run gradient descent loop

Plot cost graph

Make predictions

# Graphs

Cost vs Iterations

Actual vs Predicted

Best Fit Line (Age vs Attrition)

# How To Run

Install libraries:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

Then open Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
